### Form Corrections

Specific drills to address identified weaknesses:

#### Cadence Improvement (if <170 spm)
**Problem**: Low cadence increases impact and injury risk

**Drills**:
1. **Metronome Training**
   - Use metronome app at 170 bpm
   - 4 x 200m matching cadence
   - 2-3 times per week
   - Expected timeline: 4-6 weeks to habituate

2. **Downhill Strides**
   - Find gentle downhill (3-5% grade)
   - 6 x 100m focusing on quick turnover
   - Let gravity assist faster cadence
   - 1-2 times per week

3. **High Knees Drill**
   - 4 x 30 seconds
   - Focus on rapid leg turnover
   - Before easy runs
   - Builds neuromuscular patterns

#### Pacing Consistency (if high variance)
**Problem**: Uneven pacing wastes energy

**Strategies**:
1. **GPS Watch Discipline**
   - Set pace alerts (±5 seconds per km)
   - Check watch every 250m
   - Practice in training runs

2. **Even Effort Intervals**
   - Run intervals by feel, not pace
   - Check pace after completion
   - Learn to self-regulate

3. **Progressive Long Runs**
   - Start deliberately slow
   - Gradually increase pace
   - Builds pacing awareness

#### Heart Rate Management (if too high)
**Problem**: Unsustainable effort level

**Training**:
1. **80/20 Training**
   - 80% of runs at easy HR (Zone 2)
   - 20% at moderate-hard (Zone 3-4)
   - Builds aerobic efficiency

2. **Heart Rate Ceiling Runs**
   - Set HR limit (e.g., 150 bpm)
   - Maintain pace below that HR
   - Teaches effort regulation

3. **Recovery Emphasis**
   - Ensure 48 hours between hard sessions
   - Add extra easy day if needed
   - Prevents chronic fatigue

## Interpreting Metrics

### Pace Analysis

**What It Means**:
- Pace = Time to cover 1 kilometer
- Lower pace number = faster running
- Example: 5:00/km is faster than 6:00/km

**Pace Variance**:
- **Low variance (<5%)**: Excellent pacing consistency
- **Medium variance (5-10%)**: Acceptable pacing
- **High variance (>10%)**: Energy wasted, room for improvement

**Pacing Strategies**:

1. **Even Split**: Same pace throughout
   - Easiest to execute
   - Good for beginners
   - Reduces risk of early fatigue

2. **Negative Split**: Faster second half
   - Optimal for performance
   - Requires experience and restraint
   - Maximizes race result

3. **Positive Split**: Slower second half
   - Common in aggressive starts
   - Indicates poor pacing strategy
   - Work on starting conservatively

### Cadence Analysis

**Optimal Range**: 170-180 steps per minute

**Why It Matters**:
- Higher cadence = shorter ground contact = less impact
- Reduces injury risk to knees, hips, feet
- Improves running economy

**Your Cadence**:
- **<160 spm**: Priority improvement area
- **160-170 spm**: Work on increasing
- **170-180 spm**: Optimal range
- **>180 spm**: May indicate overstriding compensation

**Adjustments**:
- Increase cadence by 5% every 2-3 weeks
- Don't force dramatic changes
- Focus on quick, light foot strikes

### Heart Rate Analysis

**Understanding Zones**:

| Zone | % Max HR | Feel | Purpose | Time in Zone |
|------|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | 50-60% | Very easy | Recovery | Minimal in race |
| 2 | 60-70% | Easy | Aerobic base | Should be 0 in 5K |
| 3 | 70-80% | Moderate | Tempo training | Some in early km |
| 4 | 80-90% | Hard | Threshold | Majority of race |
| 5 | 90-100% | Maximum | All-out | Final km or less |

**Ideal 5K Heart Rate**:
- Should average 85-92% of max HR
- Start around 80-85% (Zone 3-4)
- Build to 90-95% (Zone 5) in final km
- If average is <85%: Left effort on the table
- If average is >95%: Likely went out too hard

**Max Heart Rate Estimation**:
- Common formula: 220 - age
- Individual variation: ±10-20 beats
- Better to test with all-out 5K effort

### Running Form Metrics

#### Vertical Oscillation
**What It Is**: Vertical bounce in running gait
**Optimal**: <10 cm
**High oscillation**: Wasted energy going up instead of forward
**Causes**: Overstriding, weak core, heel striking
**Improvements**: Cadence drills, core work, midfoot striking

#### Ground Contact Time (GCT)
**What It Is**: Time foot is on ground each step
**Optimal**: 200-250 ms
**High GCT**: Indicates heavy landing
**Low GCT**: Suggests efficient toe-off
**Note**: Varies by pace (slower = longer GCT)

#### Stride Length
**What It Is**: Distance covered per step
**Calculation**: Pace ÷ Cadence
**Optimal**: Varies by height and leg length
**Too long**: Indicates overstriding (injury risk)
**Too short**: Inefficient (increase cadence or power)
